# Employee Directory

For this project, The Random User Generator API (<https://randomuser.me/>) is used to grab information for 12 random “employees”.

A request was made to the api and a JSON object is returned. The data is parsed and displayed so that the 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
